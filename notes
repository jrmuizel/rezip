current stream format:
0: literal:
1-0x80: a 2 byte value that is either a distance or stop code
        if it's a length we also read a byte of length

possible format:
0: 1 literal byte
1-0x80: a 2 byte value that is a distance
0x81-0xfe: we can distribute these for shorter distances and runs of literals

it would be interesting to experiment with not outputing the full file
and instead just outputing in place. here's a possible format:
0: 1 literal byte follows
1-0x80: a 2 byte value that is a distance
0x81-0xfe: 2-n literal bytes follow

we could also copy the encoding that snappy uses as we're doing
basically the same thing

More efficient encoding:
 - one thing we can do to simply decrease the entropy is to encode the match
   number instead of the match offset. If we keep the existing length, this
   should often identify the match with a low number. In fact, the match
   should nearly always be the first one, because a latter one should
   nearly always be more expensive to encode.
